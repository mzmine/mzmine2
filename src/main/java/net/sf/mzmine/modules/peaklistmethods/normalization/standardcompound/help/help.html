<h1>Standard compound normalizer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this module is to reduce the deviation between samples caused by different detection efficiency. 
Internal standard peaks must be present in the detected samples.
Peak list must be aligned prior to normalization.
User can select one or multiple internal standard peaks, which must be present in all raw data files. 
Then peak height (or area) of each peak is normalized by either the nearest standard or a weighted contribution of all standards.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>This string is added to the end of the name of each processed peak list</dd>

<dt>Normalization type</dt>
<dd>Normalize intensities using either only one (nearest) standard or using a weighted contribution of all selected standards, weighted by distance. The distance of the standard peak to the peak being normalized is calculated as <i>distance = MZvsRTBalance * (MZdifference) + (RTdifference)</i>.</dd>

<dt>Peak measurement type</dt>
<dd>Selection of either peak height or peak area, which will be used to calculate the normalization factors</dd>

<dt>m/z vs RT balance</dt>
<dd>Used in distance measuring as coefficient of m/z difference.  </dd>

<dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
<dd>If selected, the original peak list is automatically removed</dd>

<dt>Standard compounds</dt>
<dd>List of peaks for choosing the normalization standards</dd>
