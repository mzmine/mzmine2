<h1>XML export and import</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
These module allow exporting the contents of the peak list into an XML file. Only the contents of the peak list are saved, raw data are not included in the export.
Default extension for the exported file is MPL (MZmine Peak List). 
The file may be optionally compressed by the ZIP algorithm prior to saving.
Both compressed and uncompressed XML files can be imported back to MZmine, although the connection to the raw data files will be lost.
</p> 

<h4>Method parameters</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Filename</dt>
<dd>Name of file where the exported data is saved</dd>

<dt>Compressed file</dt>
<dd>The XML file is compressed by ZIP algorithm before saving</dd>

</dl>

<h2>XML file structure</h2>

<p>
In the beginning of the XML file, information about the peak list (name, number of rows, applied methods) is saved. 
Following that, basic information about the raw data files structure (scan numbers and their retention times) is saved for each raw data file in the peak list.

<p>
Following the definition of raw data files, each peak list row is saved into a &lt;row&gt; element. It contains the information about peak identity and all individual peaks in the row.
For each peak, basic information about its data points (scan numbers, m/z and intensity values) is saved as arrays of <i>double</i> type encoded by Base64 encoding (the &lt;mzpeak&gt; element). 
This information is necessary for showing the peak shape in the peak list table visualizer, when the XML peak list is imported back into MZmine.
