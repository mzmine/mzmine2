<h1>Smoothing</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to the peak chromatograms in a peak list. Its main purpose is to
    remove high frequency noise from the chromatograms prior to deconvolution.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Filename suffix</dt>
    <dd>The text to append to the name of the smoothed peak list.</dd>

    <dt>Filter width</dt>
    <dd>The number of data points over which the filter kernel extends. The wider the filter the greater the smoothing
        effect.
    </dd>

    <dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
    <dd>Whether to remove the original peak list once smoothing is complete.</dd>
