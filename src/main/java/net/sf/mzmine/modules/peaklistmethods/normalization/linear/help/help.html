<h1>Linear normalizer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Linear normalizer divides the height (or area) of each peak in the peak list by a normalization factor, determined according to the Normalization type parameter.
Each column (raw data file) of the peak list is normalized separately. In other words, normalization factor is determined independently for each raw data file.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>This string is added to the end of the name of each processed peak list</dd>

<dt>Normalization type</dt>
<dd>Selection of the normalization factor</dd>

<dt>Peak measurement type</dt>
<dd>Selection of either peak height or peak area, which will be used to calculate the normalization factors</dd>

<dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
<dd>If selected, the original peak list is automatically removed</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Normalization factors</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Average intensity</dt>
<dd>Average height (or area) of all peaks in the column is calculated and used as the normalization factor</dd>

<dt>Average squared intensity</dt>
<dd>Same as Average intensity, but values are squared before calculating the average</dd>

<dt>Maximum peak intensity</dt>
<dd>Maximum height (or area) in the peak list column is used as the normalization factor</dd>

<dt>Total raw signal</dt>
<dd>Sum of the height (or area) of all peaks in the peak list column is used as the normalization factor</dd>
