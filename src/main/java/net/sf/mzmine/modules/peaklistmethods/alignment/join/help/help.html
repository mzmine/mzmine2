        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This method aligns detected peaks in different samples through a match score. This score is calculated
            based on the mass and retention time of each peak and ranges of tolerance stipulated in the parameters
            setup dialog.
        </p>

        <h4>Algorithm</h4>
        <p>
            The peak alignment algorithm uses: 
        </p>
        <p>
            1. a master list of peaks (L) against which every new sample (Sj) will be matched.
            When aligning peaks from multiple samples, the master list is initially set to the
            first sample, and subsequently it will be the combination of samples aligned thus far,
            with the samples as the columns and the matching peaks as the rows.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. for every row i in L, a two-dimensional window (where the window
            size is selected by the user), called Alignment window (AW) defining the ranges of m/z
            and RT and centered around the average of m/z and RT of all the individual peaks in the
            row; and
        </p>

        <p>
            3. a score function to compute the similarity of peaks between L and the new
            sample Sj inside the alignment window. The score function computes the similarity based on
            the similarities in m/z, retention time, and optionally on identification, and isotope patterns
            between the peaks to be matched. The score is calculated as follows:<br>  
            <i>score = ((1 - MZdifference / MZtolerance) &times; MZweight) + ((1 - RTdifference / RTtolerance) &times; RTweight)</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            The algorithm works as follows. It iterates through the rows of L, and for each row, it looks
            for peaks within the alignment window in Sj that has to be aligned with L. A score is calculated for
            each possible match and the pair getting the best score will be aligned.
        </p>
