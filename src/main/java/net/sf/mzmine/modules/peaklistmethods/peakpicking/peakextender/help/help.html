<h1>Peak extender</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This module extends the peaks in a peak list in both directions of the retention time. 
The purpose is mainly to add missing data to peak lists produced by the MS/MS Peak List Builder, which only detects a single data point per peak. 
The extending is performed scan-by-scan in both directions by searching for data points within given m/z tolerance and above given minimal height.
When no data point is found, extending is stopped.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>This string is added to the end of the name of each processed peak list</dd>

<dt>m/z tolerance</dt>
<dd>Maximum allowed distance in M/Z between data points in successive scans</dd>

<dt>Min height</dt>
<dd>Minimum allowed intensity for succesive scans. When intensity drops below this level, extending is stopped.</dd>

<dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
<dd>If selected, the original peak list is automatically removed</dd>
