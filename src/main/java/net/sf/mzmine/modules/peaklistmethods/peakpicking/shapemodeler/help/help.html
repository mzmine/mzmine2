<h1>Peak shape modeler</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This module attempts to fit the data points of a peak with an given model.
This may help to reduce the noise and improve the quantification by peak areas. 
At the current stage, this module is only <span style="color: red">experimental</span>.
</p>

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>This string is added to the end of the name of each processed peak list</dd>

<dt>Mass resolution</dt>
<dd>Mass resolution is the dimensionless ratio of the mass of the peak divided by its width.
 Peak width is taken as the full width at half maximum intensity (FWHM)</dd>

<dt>Shape model</dt>
<dd>The type of peak shape model to use. 
Triangle is a simple triangle model, designed just to demonstrate the principle. 
Gaussian (symmetric) and EMG (Exponentially Modified Gaussian; asymmetric) models may provide a better approximation of chromatographic peaks shape.</dd>

<dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
<dd>If selected, the original chromatogram is automatically removed and only deconvoluted version will remain</dd>
