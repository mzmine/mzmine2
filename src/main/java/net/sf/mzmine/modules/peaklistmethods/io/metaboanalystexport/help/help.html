<h1>MetaboAnalyst export</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This module exports the contents of the peak list into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file formatted for easy upload into the Statistical Analysis module of the <a href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca">MetaboAnalyst</a> service.
Prior to export, samples must be separated into groups by a user-defined parameter (see Project/Set sample parameters menu). Each group must contain at least 3 samples (raw data files).
</p>
