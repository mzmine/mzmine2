        <h1>Same m/z and RT range gap filler</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
               
        <p>
        	This method fills in gaps in each peak list row by using the same m/z and retention time range as other peaks in the row. 
            The m/z and retention time ranges where the new peaks will be sought are obtained using the ranges of
            the rest of the peaks in the same row. The minimum value of these ranges is the minimum value in the range
            of all the peaks in the row and the same happens with the maximum value. User-specified tolerance is added to the m/z range.
        	The new peak is constructed using the highest data point of each scan within the determined m/z and retention time ranges.
