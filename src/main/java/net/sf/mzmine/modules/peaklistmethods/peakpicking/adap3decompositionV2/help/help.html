<h1>Spectral deconvolution / Blind Source Separation</h1>

<p>
    This method performs Spectral Deconvolution of detected peaks. It finds components (compounds, analytes, etc.) and
    determines their elution profiles and fragmentation mass spectra. The Spectral Deconvolution consists of two steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Entire retention time interval is split into deconvolution windows so that</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Peaks produced by the same component or by coeluting components belong to the same deconvolution window,</li>
        <li>Number of peaks in deconvolution window is significantly smaller than the total number of peaks.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

    <li><p>Similar EIC peaks are combined into clusters. For each EIC peak, we define its <em>retention time</em> as the
        time corresponding to the peak apex and <em>retention-time range</em> as the interval
        corresponding to the peak intensity values above 5% of its apex intensity. Then the distance between two EIC
        peaks is equal to
        <p><ul type="square">
            <li> zero if the retention-time range of one EIC peak is a subset of the retention-time range of the other,</li>
            <li> infinity if the retention-time ranges of the two EIC peaks do not intersect,</li>
            <li> absolute distance between retention times of the two EIC peaks otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The EIC peaks are clustered by DBSCAN clustering algorithms and users need specify
        <em>minimum distance between clusters</em> and <em>minimum cluster size</em>. If <em>preview</em> is selected,
        the top right plot displays the result of the clustering with dots corresponding to EIC peaks and colors
            corresponding to different clusters.
    </li>

    <li>
        The number and shape of model peaks are determining by performing the non-negative matrix decomposition with
        the unimodality constrain. The number of model peaks are determined so that the shape of each model peak would
        be similar to the shape of at least one EIC peaks. The <em>Peak-Similarity tolerance</em> is used when the
        similarity is estimated.
