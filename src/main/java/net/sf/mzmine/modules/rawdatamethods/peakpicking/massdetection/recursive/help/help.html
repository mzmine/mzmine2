<h1>Recursive threshold mass detector</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This mass detector is suitable for continuous data, which has too much noise for the Exact mass detector to be used, but which shows a consistent width of m/z peaks. 
The algorithm works in a recursive way.
Initially, it looks at the whole range of data points. 
If the m/z width of this range is not within given limits, a minimum data point is found and used to split the range in two parts.
The same algorithm is then applied recursively on each part. 
Recursion continues until all m/z ranges which fit into the given width limits are found.
Final m/z values are determined as local maxima of the identified m/z ranges.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Noise level</dt>
<dd>The minimum intensity level for a data point to be considered part of a chromatogram. All data points below this intensity level are ignored.</dd>

<dt>Min m/z peak width</dt>
<dd>Minimum acceptable m/z difference between the first and last data point of an ion signal (m/z width). This parameter is used to determine when to stop the recursive search and discard peaks which are too small.</dd> 

<dt>Max m/z peak width</dt>
<dd>Maximum acceptable m/z difference between the first and last data point of an ion signal (m/z width). This parameter is used to determine when to stop the recursive search.</dd>
