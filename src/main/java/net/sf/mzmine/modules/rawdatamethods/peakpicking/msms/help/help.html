<h1>MS/MS peak picker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The MS/MS peak picker is a module for detection of peaks which has a MS/MS (MS2).
Its purpose is to look through the whole raw data, looking for MS2 scans and try to make a list of 
chromatographic peaks which has fragmentation scan (MS2).
</p><p>
First look for each MS2 scan on the selected file, obtains information of his parent scan and if a base peak ion, in the a specific range is found, 
a simple chromatographic peak is formed. The verification of a  base peak ion helps to avoid cases when the fragmentation (MS2) scan is coming from 
a random event. Each one of the detected peaks contains only one scan, after this detection is possible to use another tool like Peak detection - Peak extender.
