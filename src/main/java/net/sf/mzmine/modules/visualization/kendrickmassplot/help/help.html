<h1>Kendrick mass plot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<dt>If you use this module for your analysis or visualization, please cite:</dt>

</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Peak list</dt>
    	<dd>Select the targeted peak list.</dd>
	<dt>Peaks</dt>
    	<dd>Add peaks from the peak list.</dd>
	<dt>Kendrick mass base for y-Axis</dt>
    	<dd>Enter a sum formula which will be used as Kendrick mass base for the y-Axis.</dd>
	<dt>X-axis value</dt>
			<dd>Select which parameters you want to display on the X-Axis (Kendrick mass (KM) or m/z).</dd>
	<dt>Kendrick mass base for x-Axis</dt>
			<dd>If you want to display a Kendrick mass defect on the x-axis, check the check box and enter a sum formula as Kendrick mass base.</dd>
	<dt>Z-axis value</dt>
			<dd>Select which parameters you want to display in the third dimension. If you select "none", a 2D Kendrick mass plot will be generated.</dd>
	<dt>Kendrick mass base for z-Axis</dt>
			<dd>If you want to display a Kendrick mass defect on the z-axis in form of a heatmap, check the check box and enter a sum formula as Kendrick mass base.</dd>
	<dt>Z-axis scale value</dt>
			<dd>Choose the bounds for the Z-axis. "Percentile" allows to exclude values of a selected percentile bellow and/or above from the paint scale. Values below will be displayed in black, values above will be displayed in magenta. "Custom" allows to set costum ranges.</dd>
	<dt>Range for z-axis scale</dt>
    	<dd>Enter lower bound left and higher bound right. If you have choosen percentile for Z-axis scale the values must be between 0 and 100. If you enter 0 and 100, all values will be included in the paint scale.</dd>
	<dt>Heatmap style</dt>
		   <dd>Select the style of your paint scale. You can choose between rainbow and different monochrome color coded paint scales.</dd>

<h4>Background</h4>
<dt>In 1963 Kendrick published his idea of a mass scale, the so called Kendrick mass scale, which is based on defining the mass of CH2 as 14.0000 u.⁠ The Kendrick mass scale is calculated by multiplying the IUPAC mass scale with the factor 14.0000 u/14.01565 u = 0.9988834. This results in the same mass defect for homologous components, the so-called Kendrick mass defect (KMD). The KMD is defined as the ∆ of a nominal Kendrick mass and its associated Kendrick mass. Using the Kendrick mass scale has the purpose of data reduction. More infos: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_mass<dt>

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>
This module allows to create 2 and 3 dimensional Kendrick mass plots. All possible feature characteristics can be plotted in a third dimension. The plot window has a toolbar on the right side.
The first button changes the size of the blocks, the second toggle the background color between black and white, the third toggles the visibility of a grid and the fourth adds annotations for identified features.

<p>
A rainbow or monochrome color coded paint scale can be used for the third dimension. Depending on the dataset, a black background of the plot may result in a better contrast.

<p>
The contrast can be further improved by removing extremly high or low values from the paint scale. This can be achived using the "Range for z-axis scale" parameter. Features above the limit are displayed in magenta, features below the limit are displayed in black.

Furthermore, identified features can be labeled using the last button of the toolbar on the right.
