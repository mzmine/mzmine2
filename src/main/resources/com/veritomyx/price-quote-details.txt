Job Pricing:
============


Before Job is Started
---------------------

1) Maximum job price estimate is quoted for scans submitted (may vary by MS
   type).


When Job is Started
-------------------

2) Highest price estimate is deducted from account balance when Purchase is
   selected. (MS type is unverified.)

3) If actual job parameters disagree with initial estimates from quotation 
   phase, job execution may terminate (at no charge).

4) MS type for scans submitted is determined, and job execution proceeds.


After Job Completion
--------------------

5) If job completes more efficiently than planned, a partial refund is credited
   to customer account.
